00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.980
And now you are crying
means nothing to me

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.300
It's not for me.
Not for this love, I see

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.200
Your feelings for someone else
Your fullness flow of tears

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.560
Our days has gone by

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.080
If...
Our hearts can't make a sound

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.300
Love is now far and bitter

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.480
And then...

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.060
You were coming back

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.860
Without shining smile
you had given

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.780
Wind is blowing,
but ain't the same

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.820
Who, I don't know

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.240
And now I know
Our love story is nothing left

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.180
When spring sun shine comes
Whispering the sweet words

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.920
You turned away
For something miracle

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.580
As we first met

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.640
And now the tears you shed
Means nothing to me

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.500
It's not for me
Not for this love, I see

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.380
Your feelings for someone else
Your fullness flow of tears

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.760
Our days has gone by

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.080
If...
Those rose came back

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.320
The love incense branch on occasion swears

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.040
I wish that...

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.420
One day I can come

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.240
Pick you up for morning walk

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.640
But that is impossible dreams

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.540
Who, I don't know

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.540
And now I know
Our love story is nothing left

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.520
When spring sun shine comes
Whispering the sweet words

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.340
You turned away
For something miracle

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.000
As we first met

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.960
And now the tears you shed
Means nothing to me

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.580
It's not for me
Not for this love, I see

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.740
Your feelings for someone else
Your fullness flow of tears

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.400
Our days has gone by

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.400
And now I know
Our love story is nothing left

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.280
When spring sun shine comes
Whispering the sweet words

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.120
You turned away
For something miracle

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.340
As we first met

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.820
And now the tears you shed
Means nothing to me

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.640
It's not for me
Not for this love, I see

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.540
Your fullness flow of tears

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.360
Because of you, because of you
